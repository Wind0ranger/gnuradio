     *  Input: Synchronized FFT vectors after OFDM demodulation (frequency domain) (N MIMO branches parallel).
     *  - Extract data carriers and dump zero-carriers and pilot-carriers on each MIMO branch.
     *  - Use pilot carriers to estimate the channel coefficients for these carriers on each MIMO branch.
